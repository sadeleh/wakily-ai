## 🏆 The Geek Challenge

**Hey Ahmad Abu Saa!** We challenge you to take this project to the next level of geekiness! Here are some ideas:

1. Implement a real-time code collaboration feature that allows for pair programming in Arabic
2. Create a CLI interface that interacts with the Wakily API using ASCII art animations
3. Add a Matrix-style terminal that actually processes and understands Arabic commands
4. Build a VS Code extension that brings Wakily's Arabic AI capabilities into the IDE
5. Develop a quantum computing simulator that processes Arabic language patterns

Show us what you've got! Fork this repo and let's see how much geekier you can make it!
